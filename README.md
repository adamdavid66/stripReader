Source image set

3 sets of data each consisting of 37 images
All images have been taken with the same camera settings. The settings can be found in the EXIF data

Each group consists of:
1 reference image of the test before it has been used called set[1..3]-reference.jpg
12 tests at different concentrations, 3 tests per concentration
The concentrations are written on the card in the image however the filename also indicates the
concentration so it can be parsed by code if required during development
